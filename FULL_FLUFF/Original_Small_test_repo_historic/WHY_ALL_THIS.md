I am working towards some bigger tests that failed last year, I failed at sparsification of attention, I made too many additions ALL AT ONCE, this is where I Break IT ALL THE FUCK DOWN, the ND algo came from those tests and I'm converting all my Jupyter/Collab notebooks into usable code for my datamutant library, this is so I can do experiments withut having to do silly enourmous notebooks as I did previously, it for me not for you yet LOL
